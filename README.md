# IBscheduler
A simple Qt5 program for creating school schedules. It allows every student to attend different classes (like for example in IB programs) and marks overlaps in the schedule.

## Building
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
make all
```
After building the path to the executable will be `"dist/IB Scheduler"`
